GENERAL IN TRODUOTION

——000—

CORNELIUS NEPos was born about the year

than a man of action, and attempted, as Catullus
says in dedicating his poems to Nepos,

not that of a modern scientific historian3 Nepos
pa-ints with a broad touch, and is not too critical

of details, His biographies, however, have decided
