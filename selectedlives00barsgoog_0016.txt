human interest, and he shows in them a sympa-
thy with foreign ideas quite unusual in a Roman.
His fondness for the study of Greek, besides
thus broadening his mind, may have been a bond
in the friendship existing between him and the
learned Atticus. The orator Cicero was also a
friend of Atticus, and in turn became the friend
of Nepos.

Besides the “History of the World'' referred
to in the passage from Catullus given above, Nepos
wrote many other workS, all of which are lost,
except a portion of his book “De Viris Illustribu8.”
Of the sixteen or more 'books into which this was
divided, we have only one, “De Excellentibus Du-
cibus Exterarum Gentium,'' from which the selec-
tions in this volume are taken, and part of an-
other, “De Historicis Latinis,'' embracing the lives
of Cato the Censor and of Titus Pomponius Atticus,
who has already been mentioned.

The purpose of these biographies can be inferred
from the “Praefatio ” 3 namely, to present men for
their enlightenment and instruction with an ac-
count of the deeds of great men of all times
and nations. ’
