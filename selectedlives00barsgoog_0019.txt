Ι . GREECE

Tm: great period of Greek history lies between
600 and 300 13.c. Within that time three states in
turn reared themselves to a position above their
felloWS, only to be overthrown by the combined
fear and envy of the others. They were Athens,
Sparta, and Thebes3 and of these states the Greeks
whose lives are here included were citizens,—
Miltiades, AristideS, Themistocles, and AlcibiadeS,
of Athens; Lysander of Sparta3 and Epaminondas
of Thebes.

Before any of these powers came into serious
conflict with one another, they had to fight an
enemy who threatened them from without. DariuS,
king of Persia, who had already got possession
of the Greek cities which fringed the coast of

Asia Minor, began toturn his eyes towards Europe.
