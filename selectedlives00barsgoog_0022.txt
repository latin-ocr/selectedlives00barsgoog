IL· HANNIBAL AND THE PUNIC WARS

To understand the deep enmity which brought ’

Rome and Carthage together in the Punic ¹ wars,
and which filled Hannibal with his undying hatred
of the RomanS, one must know something of the
early history of Carthage.

The Canaanites, named Phoenicians by the
Greeks, inhabited a strip of coast-land · north of
Palestine and west of the Lebanon range, whither
the-y had been driven by the invasion of the
Hebrews under J oshua. Dwelling in a narrow
land, they turned to the sea for support, and
became the greatest navigator-s and traders of
antiquity. Their ships sailed westward over the
Mediterranean, even to the shores of Britain,
carrying the manufactures of the East, and ex-
changing them for the raw materials which other
countries produced. Everywhere they established
trading posts, many of which grew into cities.

1 From the Greek Φοινίκη (Phoenice), ‘⁴ Purple·land,'’ comes
the Latin Poeni, ‘⁸ Phoenicians,'’ and the adjective Punicus,
“Phoenician.'' The last two words are regularly applied to
the Carthaginians, who were of Phoenician extraction.
