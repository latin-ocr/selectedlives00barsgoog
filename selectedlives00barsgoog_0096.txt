8. 11: the tendency in Latin would be to have a relative here.

PAon 2.—1. omnibus: dative of reference. While “to” or
“for” generally gives the main idea of the dative, it is often
best rendered by an adverbial clause. Here translate ‘⁴ in
everybody’s opinion.”

honesta does not mean “honest” in the modern sense, but
is the opposite of turpia.. For an English use os “ honest ” in
the Latin sense, compare the expression in the New Testament,

of ablative contains a mixture of the ideas of instrument and
specification, being equivalent to either ‘⁴ judged by ’² or ‘⁸ hav-
ing reference to.” In such cases —and they are many in Latin
—the student should search sor the English idiom which best
fits into the rest os the sentence.
