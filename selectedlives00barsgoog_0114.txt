88 CORNELII NEPOTIS

10. ipsorum: used here, as frequently, as indirect reflexive,
to refer to a subject other than that of the principal clause. εδ,

3. testularum suffragiis: “ ostracism '' (literally, “ potsherd-
votes '’). At Athens, when the prominence of two public men
seemed likely to cause a deadlock or other difficulty, the people
were called together and voted for the banishment of one or the
other. Originally the ballot used was an oyster—shell, Gk. ostra-
kon, whence the name; afterwards a tile or potsherd was used.
Aman was not ostracised unless he received at least six thousand
votes. The banishment lasted for ten yearS, but involved neither
confiscation of property nor permanent loss of civic rights. In
later timeS, through abuse and evasion‚ the defects of ostracism
began to appear, and the custom fell into disuse.

Molossians were the strongest of the tribes which inhabited
Epirus, or Northwestern Greece. One of their later kings was
Pyrrhus, who made war on the Romans.

14. hospitium: in early times, when all strangers were looked
on as enemies, travellers in foreign lands were not safe unless
protected by the hospitality of some native of the country. To
secure this protection or hospitium they had to be recommended
to their host either ou the score of previous acquaintance or by
a mutual friend. Themistocles, not having this right, took the
measures to ensure his safety described in the text.
