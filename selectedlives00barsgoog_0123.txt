NOTES 97

4. 11. opprimeret: subjunctive (“integral part''—“attrac-
tion '’), because simply an expansion ot existeret. It is thus
equivalent to -et ne ea vis opprimeret.

14. opera forensi: i.e. by acting as their advocate in lawsuits.

5. 16. prodisset: see note on opprimeret, above.

6. 21. mysteria: carefully guarded rites, performed at Eleu-
siS, near Athens. It is believed that, in connection with the
myth of Demeter and Persephone, the planting and growth of
the seed was made a symbol of death and immortality. There
were other mysteria, but these, the Eleusinian, were the most
important.

22. m5re: ablativo of respect.

IV. 1. 25. c6nti6ne: see note on Aristide8‚ § Ι, 8,1.4. Besides
their legislative dutieS, the members of the Athenian assembly
also acted as jurors, the whole body of citizens being divided
into large groupS, called dicasteries‚ any one of which, with its
presiding archon, constituted a court.

PAon: 32. - 2. vellent: direct, vultis.

praesente: sc. εδ.

haberetur: the subjunctive, after verbs of asking‚ command-
ing, and the like, is frequently found without ut, this being
probably the original construction.

3. invidiae crimine: “ an accusation due to ill will.'’

2. 4. quifiscendum: impersonal. Sc. sibi (esse).

noceri: impersonal. “Not possible for injury to be done
him.’' See A. 2303 Β. 138, 4; G. 208, 2; H. 301, 1.

5. dnteuegebant: notice the use of the indicative, implying
that the statement is made on the author's own authority and
is no part of the sentence depending on decrssv'firunt.

6. exisset: their thought was ‘⁴ quo exierit.'' ΟΥ. the pre-
ceding note.

3. 10. magistratu: not necessarily any particular magistrate,
but, as we should say, “ the government.’'

In this sentence notice with great care the subjunctives de-
pending on cum, so as not to begin the principal clause too soon.

11. esset . . . spe: “ began to feel very confident.''
