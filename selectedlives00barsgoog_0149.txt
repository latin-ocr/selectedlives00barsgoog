and but few his equals. By the utmost industry he „
became illustrious. His father did not look with
favour upon him, because he lived too fast a life,
and accordingly (itaque) he disinherited him. By
this misfortune he was not crushed, but lifted.

ΙΙ. The state was rendered fiercer when the
people appointed Themistocles general. The Athe-
nians were persuaded by him to wage war with
(cum) the Corcyraeans. When these had been
crushed, then the pirates (use both ‘noun and
adjective) were pursued, and the sea rendered
safe. The Athenians became skilled in war, and
a source-of-safety to the whole of Greece. It was
said that when Xerxes invaded Greece, he aimed
especially at the Athenians, on account of the
battle of Marathon. They were persuaded to
defend themselves by [their] wooden walls.
