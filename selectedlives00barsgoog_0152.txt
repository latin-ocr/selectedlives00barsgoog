126 CORNELII ΝΕΡο Tzs

X. Because the king admired Alcibiades' high
spirit, he wanted him to be on his side. When
he had become versed in the Persian language, he
made the king many acceptable (say “many and
acceptable ²⁹) promises, It is said that he took
poison intentionally, because he could not subdue
Greece by war, and that he was buried first (pri-
mum) at Magnesia, then (deinde) in Attica.

⁶ ARISTIDES

1. When Aristides and Themistocles were engaged
in rivalry with each other, the former (ille) was sen-
tenced to ten years' exile. Since the mob could not
be checked, he went away. A certain man was
not pleased because he was called The Just. It is
said that the eloquence of Themistocles proved to be
of more avail than the integrity of Aristides.

ΙΙ. After the barbarians had been routed at Pla-
taea, Aristides brought it about (effecit) that the
Athenians should be leaders on the sea. On account
of Pausanias' arrogance and Aristides' acts of fair-
nes& many states of Greece joined the Athenian
alliance. If Aristides had not been released from
his punishment, this could not have happened.
