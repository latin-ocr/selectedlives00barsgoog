WORD-GROUPS

—Ooh—

Nona—The following list has been designedly left incom-
plete. Word-groups, according to the editor‘s view, should be
primarily a mnemonic help. Etymology as such ought in the
beginning to be a side-issue only, the pupil's first efforts being
concentrated on the acquisition of a good stock of useful Latin
words rather than on the study of their comparative anatomy.
Accordingly, the very small groups have nearly all been omitted,
as well as those in which the root-meaning does not plainly help
the memory. For instance, the development of equus, eques,
and equitatus from a root meaning “swift'’ is a curious and not
uninteresting sact; but one would scarcely care to assert that
in practice the pupil would very willingly tread the mental path
from ‘⁶ swift ’¹ to ‘⁴ horse,'’ ‘⁰ horseman,’' and “ cavalry '' merely
that he might follow the track of the language in its search after
appropriate names sor those three obJ'ects. When, however,
the root does really and easily suggest the word, it becomes a
most usetul means of binding scattered factS, and well adapted
to the purpose of elementary language—study.
