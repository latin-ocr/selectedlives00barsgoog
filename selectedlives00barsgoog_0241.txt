“By ⁸ school classice· 1 mean classice with commentar-ies for nse in
schools, and by describing the book as a ‘companion’ to these, Ι mean
that it attempts to give the information which a commentator 18, from
the nature of his task, compelled to assume even in a young student.
My alm 18 to place before a young student a nucleus of well-ordered
knowledge, to which he is to add intelligent notes and illustratione from
his daily reading.” -· From the Presace. ·

“Μ1. Gow has presented a vast amount of information in a small
compass3 yet it is so well arranged, and so clearly stated? that, notwith-
standing its condensation‚ it is read with ease and ple-neure. Indeed,
we do not know where to look for so good an account of Athenian and
Roman public affairs in a form at once clear, concise, and full enough
for ordinary studente as Mr. Gow has here given us.” — Science.

“He has made nse of the most recent authorities, and the young
student will find the pith of many books in the space of less than 400
pages. . . . Much of the information would be sought to no purpose
in the ordinary manuale, and what is given is conveyed in its true
connection.” — Nation.

“ Excellently planned and admirably executed. The author—for Mr.
stow 18 more than a compiler— has had a distinct object in view. He is
a distinguished student of the classice, and he is an eminent practical
teacher. With such dualiflcations, we turn with confidence to a reliable
book.” — Educational Times.
