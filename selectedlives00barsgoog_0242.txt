The Saturday Review says: “The book ia a good one. The exer·
elaea are plentiful, and the words which they eontain are euch aa will be
uaeful to learnera when they pass on to higher work.”

The Lites-ary World says: “ The young learner who cannot ⁸ get on
with’ his Latin under so simple and gemm-progressive a course aa Mr.
Oook has here laid down, had better be allowed ω give it up altogether.
The teaeher’a work has been greatly simplified and leaeened by the
omission of any advaneed rulea or complex examplee. . . . The book
seems to us admirably suited for girls’ schoola ae well aa for boye’, and
itis marvellouely well printed and got up for the price charged.”

The Glaeyow Herald says: “This manual is admirably adapted to
the Latin requirementa of the Scotch Code for the first year. All the
ground is covered, and the exercisea for translation from and into Latin
are numerous and judiciously arranged. The plan of the book is one
by which the pupil is made to take stock of his knowledge at every step,
and security is thus got for the foundation in Latin grammar being soundly
laid. The book is likely to become a favorite. . . . The book ie admir-
ably simple and practieal.” -
